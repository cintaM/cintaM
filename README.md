### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cinta MÃ¡rquez!

I'm making a career change and would like to go into web programming. 

I have done several trainings in both front and back developer.

ðŸ‘€ I am especially interested in Full Stack developer positions, although I can adapt perfectly to other positions. 

My previous work experience has been as a technical recruiter so the constant search for solutions to problems,
contact with customers / users, teamwork and constant adaptation to changes are characteristics that define me. 

My technology stack:

- Javascript/Typescript

- Vue.js

- Angular (not Angular js)

- Java/ Spring Boot

- Node

- HTML5

- CSS3

In my projects I have used various programs or resources both in the design part and to obtain data such as:

- MySQL

- SQLite

- Postman

- Bootstrap

- ANTDesign

- Vuetify

- PrimeNg

- Figma

...and others

Need to know more details about me or my work?

Contact me through LinkedIn "https://www.linkedin.com/in/cinta-m%C3%A1rquez-/" and I will get back to you ASAP.
